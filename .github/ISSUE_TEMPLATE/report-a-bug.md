The Darknet/YOLO discord may be best for support and feature discussions:  https://discord.gg/CPZJPSYZU2

In August 2025, the Darknet/YOLO repo moved from Github to Codeberg:  https://codeberg.org/CCodeRun/darknet#table-of-contents
For quicker replies, consider creating new issues on Codeberg instead of Github.
