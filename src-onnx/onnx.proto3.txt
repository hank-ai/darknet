The onnx.proto3.pb.* source files are generated from the onnx.proto3 file which exists in the official ONNX repo.
Normally, users of Darknet/YOLO do not need to worry about this as the .proto3 file is also checked into the
Darknet/YOLO repo for convenience, and the process of calling the Protocol Buffer compiler is now automatically
handled in the CMake file.

It is documented here for future Darknet/YOLO developers when a new version of the ONNX .proto3 file is released.

First step is to download the latest onnx.proto3 file from the ONNX project:

    https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/onnx/onnx.proto3
or:
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onnx/onnx/refs/heads/main/onnx/onnx.proto3

The last time this was done was by St√©phane Charette on 2025-10-20.

The Protocol Buffer compile step that generates the .h and .cc files is as follows:

	sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
	protoc --fatal_warnings --cpp_out=. onnx.proto3

This will generate the necessary onnx.proto3.pb.* source files.  In v5.0 these source files were checked into git but
this causes a problem when Darknet/YOLO is then compiled by Visual Studio.  It was complaining that the .cc file was
generated by a different compiler.

Note the that while the onnx.proto3 source file is now checked into the Darknet/YOLO repo as of v5.1, this file does
not belong to Darknet/YOLO!  The ONNX project should always be considered to be newer or more "official".

Command used to display as plain text the contents of .onnx files:

	protoc --decode=onnx.ModelProto onnx.proto3 < example.onnx

In regards to licensing:

- The ONNX project uses the Apache 2 license.
- The source files generated by protoc pulls in additional Google Protocol Buffer headers which also use the Apache 2 license.
- Darknet/YOLO uses the exact same Apache 2 license.
