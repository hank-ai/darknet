The onnx.pb.* source files are generated from the onnx.proto file which exists
in the official ONNX repo.  Normally, users of Darknet/YOLO do not need to do
this as the output files are already checked into the Darknet/YOLO repo.

It is documented here so the source files can be updated by the Darknet/YOLO
developers when a new version of the ONNX .proto file is released.

First step is to download the latest onnx.proto file from the ONNX project:

    https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/onnx/onnx.proto3
or:
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onnx/onnx/refs/heads/main/onnx/onnx.proto3

The last time this was done was by Stephane Charette on 2025-10-20.

Then, the protocol buffer compiler is used to generate the C++ files:

    sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
    protoc --fatal_warnings --cpp_out=. onnx.proto3

This will generate the necessary onnx.proto3.pb.* source files.

This could be done with CMake using find_package(Protobuf) combined with the
macro protobuf_generate_cpp(...) but as of July 2025 it is expected that an
updated onnx.proto3 file and corresponding generated files will be extremely
rare, so for now it remains a manual process in the Darknet/YOLO repo.

Note the onnx.proto3 file is not retained in the Darknet/YOLO repo.  That
file should be considered as residing in the ONNX project repo, and if it
was checked in as part of Darknet/YOLO then there might be confusion as to
who "owns" the file, or who has the most recent version.  The ONNX version
must always be considered to be newer and/or more "official".

Command used to display as plain text the contents of .onnx files:

    protoc --decode=onnx.ModelProto onnx.proto3 < example.onnx

In regards to licensing:

- The ONNX project uses the Apache 2 license.
- The source files generated by protoc pulls in additional Google Protocol Buffer headers which also use the Apache 2 license.
- Darknet/YOLO uses the exact same Apache 2 license.
