	/** The timing and tracking functionality is used to find places in the code where optimizations should be made.  Since
	 * the original authors are no longer active in the Darknet/YOLO project, there is a lot of unknown code.  This class
	 * is used to time each function, and the results are stored in the @ref TimingRecords object.  When Darknet exits, the
	 * results are shown in a table.
	 *
	 * Running with this enabled will slow down Darknet!  By a significant amount.  It is not meant to be used by "normal"
	 * users, but instead by developers.  When building Darknet, you have to give it an extra parameter when you run the
	 * cmake command.  For example:
	 *
	 * ~~~~
	 * cd build
	 * cmake -DENABLE_TIMING_AND_TRACKING=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
	 * ~~~~
	 *
	 * Note that @p "Debug" is not needed for this functionality.  It will work just the same in @p "Release" mode.
